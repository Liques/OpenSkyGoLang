# OpenSkyGoLang
A package built in using Go intented to load airplanes data from the OpenSky API (www.opensky.org).

This is testing repo that I am using this project as the main way to learn Go, but if you already are a Go developer and is looking for some sources for using OpenSky API, feel free to use the resources present here.
